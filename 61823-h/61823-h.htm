<blockquote>
<p>This poem was not written to bring fame,
nor to waft a fortune; for, fame and fortune
are but small incidents when compared with
the higher things in life. It was composed
more for pleasure&mdash;the pleasure of meditating
on, and the commemorating of, the
splendid people who were among the many
fine early settlers of this state; and likewise
to impart this joy to the readers who may
peruse this little story of pioneer days.</p>

<p>Then the old &#8220;Spelling Down&#8221;&mdash;once so
common in schools and so brilliant for its
academic value, and keen social enjoyment&mdash;should
be rescued from oblivion; yea even
revived.</p>

<p>If the sending forth of these simple stanzas
should bear any fruit, may some of these
be the happy harvest.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O worthy friends, at last we&#8217;ve met again;</div>
<div class="indent">I feel that we have met in days before;</div>
<div class="verse">And hope as gladly now as we did then,</div>
<div class="indent">To contemplate some things in days of yore;</div>
<div class="verse">In those days when our parents still were young,</div>
<div class="verse">And we in youth around the school house swung.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It won&#8217;t take long&mdash;a fleet winged hour or two&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">So, let us raise the curtain of the past,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring again those good old days to view,</div>
<div class="indent">Which are long fled in years that sped too fast;</div>
<div class="verse">Let us together take a pleasant trip</div>
<div class="verse">On mem&#8217;ry&#8217;s wings for kind companionship.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In those good times of years long, long ago</div>
<div class="indent">Were many hardships, that we should forget;</div>
<div class="verse">But still, among these troubles, toils, and woe,</div>
<div class="indent">Were sunny spots that will delight us yet.</div>
<div class="verse">And one of those affected by this rule</div>
<div class="verse">Is the old time rollicking spelling school.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The young folks of today would scarcely guess</div>
<div class="indent">Their fathers and their mothers, in those times,</div>
<div class="verse">Could stand for hours the stern onslaught and stress</div>
<div class="indent">Of stubborn words, in long contending lines&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Arranged around the dingy school house wall</div>
<div class="verse">To see who was the speller best of all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The country school was then the favorite nook&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">A kind of home spun university&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Where old and young their worth in spelling book</div>
<div class="indent">Exhibited in a friendly rivalry.</div>
<div class="verse">And those of later times, of course, don&#8217;t know</div>
<div class="verse">What they without these sports sadly forego.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Those spelling schools did more in their plain ways</div>
<div class="indent">For all young folks, than now is done for few,</div>
<div class="verse">In costly schools, in these progressive days&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">And they were common once. West of the Blue,</div>
<div class="verse">There were five districts that were wont to meet</div>
<div class="verse">In contest in this most delightful feat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Blue Valley and Deer Creek lay to the north;</div>
<div class="indent">Each one a ready, lusty vanquisher;</div>
<div class="verse">And smiling Prairie Gem lay to the south;</div>
<div class="indent">Raemer Creek on the west, now Herkimer;</div>
<div class="verse">And Pleasant Ridge, my rural alma mater,</div>
<div class="verse">In midst of all, and just a trifle greater.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When corn was husked and hard farm work was done,</div>
<div class="indent">The winter evenings long and restless grew;</div>
<div class="verse">Then country folks would long for that blithe fun</div>
<div class="indent">That they before from the quaint school house drew.</div>
<div class="verse">Some teachers then with pupils did contrive</div>
<div class="verse">To hold a spelling school among the five.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And these were founts of pleasure, sparkling, sweet,</div>
<div class="indent">To which the neighboring schools invited were.</div>
<div class="verse">The purpose was in spelling them to beat;</div>
<div class="indent">And therein lay the honors striven for.</div>
<div class="verse">For those events the spelling book was learned</div>
<div class="verse">Complete, and bowls of midnight oil were burned.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas wont for parents to pronounce at home</div>
<div class="indent">Words by the pages to their children then;</div>
<div class="verse">Until McGuffey&#8217;s text by heart was known&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">By the whole household, even the hired men.</div>
<div class="verse">No wonder that we heard old settlers tell:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;In those wise days people knew how to spell.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The district that would entertain the rest</div>
<div class="indent">Of schools, gratis prepared a play program&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Of songs and declamations, the very best,</div>
<div class="indent">And dialogs in which much laughter ran.</div>
<div class="verse">Herein, no doubt, young Thespians took part</div>
<div class="verse">Who through hearty encore obtained their start.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Those spelling bees! O, with what rare delight,</div>
<div class="indent">For weeks ahead we them anticipated!</div>
<div class="verse">They were the magnets of those winter nights;</div>
<div class="indent">No storm or cold them e&#8217;er obliterated.</div>
<div class="verse">When those glad nights came, countless faces beamed</div>
<div class="verse">In country school houses where bright lights gleamed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Altho &#8217;twas long ago, still I recall</div>
<div class="indent">The happy crowds within those temples wee;</div>
<div class="verse">And marvel how they could contain them all;</div>
<div class="indent">But they were all on hand, and so were we.</div>
<div class="verse">In an old adage you know it is told:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Many gentle sheep go in a small fold.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The old time songs were with much pleasure fraught,</div>
<div class="indent">When by gray-haired sires or sweet maidens sung;</div>
<div class="verse">The dialogs oft bursts of laughter brought,</div>
<div class="indent">As actors new their characters well flung.</div>
<div class="verse">And ne&#8217;er did foot lights play house Booths enfire</div>
<div class="verse">As wild applause did our young stars inspire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No scroll of Prairie Gem would be complete</div>
<div class="indent">That not of Mrs. Jeffry&#8217;s actors told;</div>
<div class="verse">Or Cottrell&#8217;s pupils invincible and sweet,</div>
<div class="indent">That oft at bay contending lines did hold:</div>
<div class="verse">For Golden Valley, where these districts lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Well knew these folks could ably spell and play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This part could boast of sturdy families;</div>
<div class="indent">Yet modestly these bore their worthy lots:</div>
<div class="verse">Stauffachers, Guises, Brennans, Babbisches,</div>
<div class="indent">Murphys, Armstrongs, Yaussis, Jeffrys and Otts;</div>
<div class="verse">Pachas and Trienens, Seematters and Dow;</div>
<div class="verse">And others that I have forgotten now.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And Herkimer should ever brightly shine</div>
<div class="indent">For blithe savants: Carbott and McConnaughey;</div>
<div class="verse">No school house feast could glow without their chime&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Their choral gems and jocund roundelay.</div>
<div class="verse">And over many snowy miles we&#8217;d swing</div>
<div class="verse">To hear these two declaim, debate, or sing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Its violin players were hard to beat:</div>
<div class="indent">Whoe&#8217;er heard Clark Stewart play &#8220;The Mocking Bird&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">At spelling schools, they heard a heavenly treat:</div>
<div class="indent">To be enraptured was but to have heard.</div>
<div class="verse">Here, likewise, too, held voluptuous sway</div>
<div class="verse">The Schumacher dulcet stringed orchestra.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This district had its great families too:</div>
<div class="indent">The Runkles, Schumachers and Dorfeners;</div>
<div class="verse">Niemanns, Emmerts, Kellers, Hickeys and True,</div>
<div class="indent">Lyndes, Amelunxens, Koenekes, Raemers&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Most, pioneers who in the sixties came,</div>
<div class="verse">And helped the prairie&#8217;s wild frontier to tame.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And Deer Creek! fairest district of the dell!</div>
<div class="indent">If spelled with &#8220;a&#8221; instead of &#8220;e&#8221; no seer</div>
<div class="verse">Could have objected: here did truly dwell</div>
<div class="indent">A hundred pretty girls for ev&#8217;ry deer.</div>
<div class="verse">And all could laugh and spell and sing and play,</div>
<div class="verse">So that the coldest heart turned glad and gay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Among the worthy families were, Schmidlers,</div>
<div class="indent">And Cockerills, and Watsons, Travelutes;</div>
<div class="verse">McKees and Severns, Koppeses, and Winklers;</div>
<div class="indent">Sedlaceks, Tatlocks, Websters, Keys and Lutz&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And teachers great like Shaner, Prichard, Barbour,</div>
<div class="verse">Charley Travelute and Lizzie Mohrbacher.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Blue Valley too, still famous from its grange,</div>
<div class="indent">Held many wizards of the spelling book;</div>
<div class="verse">And hence we always tho&#8217;t it something strange</div>
<div class="indent">If in such contests they no honors took:</div>
<div class="verse">The Rogers, Cottrells, Fultons and Blackmars,</div>
<div class="verse">Had lasses that could spell to beat the stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In songs and plays they also were real good;</div>
<div class="indent">Their literary parts were out of sight:</div>
<div class="verse">We ne&#8217;er went to their fettas but we stood</div>
<div class="indent">Chuckful of irrepressible delight.</div>
<div class="verse">And their forensic sons were known to fame;</div>
<div class="verse">Their laurels sprang from many a wordy game.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The story of this vale would lose its sheen</div>
<div class="indent">Here to withhold the names these tales arouse;</div>
<div class="verse">As Butler, Benson, Schultz, Mayhew and Green,</div>
<div class="indent">Herring, McNulty, Spealman, Bull and Howes:</div>
<div class="verse">And they all strove most earnestly, at least,</div>
<div class="verse">To make the West twice as great as the East.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And Pleasant Ridge, the heart of this quintette,</div>
<div class="indent">Embowered in a vale that always gave</div>
<div class="verse">A hearty welcome to the neighboring set,</div>
<div class="indent">Likewise to worth and wisdom, strong and brave&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Modestly it gave the gauntlet and took,</div>
<div class="verse">Of friend and foe in bout in spelling book.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Often its sons and daughters bravely stood</div>
<div class="indent">In neighboring schools of the prairie white,</div>
<div class="verse">Defending their record envied and good,</div>
<div class="indent">And win or lose, put up a stubborn fight.</div>
<div class="verse">Altho they lost sometimes a spelling fray,</div>
<div class="verse">More often were bedecked with laurels gay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It too had singers fine; they were replete;</div>
<div class="indent">Song was spontaneous as to glad bird:</div>
<div class="verse">Their voices blended charmingly and sweet:</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Twas joy to hear them, but grief when not heard.</div>
<div class="verse">The Tarvins were singers; like them no other;</div>
<div class="verse">Mattie and Sally, Lewis and their mother.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It also had school masters, great and good,</div>
<div class="indent">Whose memory the pupils will e&#8217;er bless;</div>
<div class="verse">Who&#8217;re wise and kind and childhood understood,</div>
<div class="indent">And worshipped for meekness and gentleness:</div>
<div class="verse">Miss Kister, Thomas Randolph and John King,</div>
<div class="verse">Frank Paul, Pierce Hickey and F. D. Joslyn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of all our teachers tho&#8217;, Gallaher was king:</div>
<div class="indent">He taught us how to carol, like the birds;</div>
<div class="verse">His &#8220;Ring, Then Ring Ye Light Fairy Bells&#8221; will ring</div>
<div class="indent">In my ears long as I recall those words.</div>
<div class="verse">He was a singing master; were there more</div>
<div class="verse">In rural schools to-day, the country o&#8217;er.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Concerning disputants, we had them too:</div>
<div class="indent">Fair Prairie Gem might flaunt Hiner and Guise;</div>
<div class="verse">But these two Haynes full well our Websters knew&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">George Tarvin, Edwin Neal&mdash;for, surely twice,</div>
<div class="verse">The two won in debates to th&#8217; others once;</div>
<div class="verse">And Golden Valley&#8217;s speakers shunned no chance.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We also had good spellers in this valley;</div>
<div class="indent">But our hope and strength depended on these three&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Kind Peter Kerschen, Emma Kister, Sally</div>
<div class="indent">Tarvin&mdash;these were our shining galaxy.</div>
<div class="verse">Victory that by them could not be wrought,</div>
<div class="verse">We knew it had been very dearly bought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some hardy families besides the ones</div>
<div class="indent">Named, lived within this district&#8217;s charming dells&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Links, Koppeses, Parishes, Warringtons,</div>
<div class="indent">Behrens, Ottos, Heisters, Talbots, Hunts, Hartwells&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And they all strove as ardent as they could</div>
<div class="verse">To keep its name unsullied, fair and good.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The people of these country districts, five,</div>
<div class="indent">Were pioneers who in the far years came.</div>
<div class="verse">It was their sterling worth that kept alive</div>
<div class="indent">The steady progress on this cheerless plain,</div>
<div class="verse">And changed it from a bluestem coyote ward</div>
<div class="verse">Into the fields and gardens of the Lord.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">These people were no better and no worse</div>
<div class="indent">Than those of other rural communities</div>
<div class="verse">Of which God built many. He knew their force</div>
<div class="indent">In moving this world&#8217;s plain activities;</div>
<div class="verse">And &#8217;tho oft used as theme for jests and jokes</div>
<div class="verse">They e&#8217;er have been, still are, the cream of folks.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some names of these, no doubt, I have forgot;</div>
<div class="indent">And hence, they do not here within appear:</div>
<div class="verse">For time and toil the keenest mind will blot;</div>
<div class="indent">Yet so, for each left out, I shed a tear.</div>
<div class="verse">Those names, I&#8217;m sure, would help to grace these rhymes</div>
<div class="verse">And garnish this fond tale of former times.</div>
</div></div></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART II<br />

<small>THE CONTEST</small></h2></div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In eighties, while these schools were at their best,</div>
<div class="indent">And pupils from all these refined homes were</div>
<div class="verse">Bent on hard study, with good teachers blest,</div>
<div class="indent">Some splendid spelling schools did then occur</div>
<div class="verse">In each district one winter. It was then</div>
<div class="verse">The last was held in Pleasant Ridge, a gem.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The score was even; they must hold yet one;</div>
<div class="indent">This was to tell for all the final fate.</div>
<div class="verse">They all longed for this great event to come;</div>
<div class="indent">The tenth of February was the date.</div>
<div class="verse">We all had vowed, no matter what it took,</div>
<div class="verse">We must not fail to know the spelling book.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Three weeks of time we had yet to prepare;</div>
<div class="indent">And the home school should furnish the program.</div>
<div class="verse">Our teacher, Emma Kister, said, &#8220;With care,</div>
<div class="indent">Pupils, we must arrange our work and plan,</div>
<div class="verse">Or else the victory will not be ours;</div>
<div class="verse">We have to entertain and fight four powers.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She named a council with her to advise;</div>
<div class="indent">They placed the poorer spellers in the plays;</div>
<div class="verse">The small ones gave &#8220;a piece&#8221; to memorize;</div>
<div class="indent">And got the non-combatants of those days</div>
<div class="verse">To play guitars and violins, and sing.</div>
<div class="verse">This truly proved to be the very thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We spelled down every Friday afternoon;</div>
<div class="indent">And the last week we did that ev&#8217;ry day;</div>
<div class="verse">Rehearsed the declamations ev&#8217;ry noon;</div>
<div class="indent">And in the evening practiced ev&#8217;ry play.</div>
<div class="verse">So when came on the tenth of February,</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;d all in trim and all a-feeling merry.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The other districts also plotted, planned;</div>
<div class="indent">And studied early, late and overtime.</div>
<div class="verse">If kerosene had not then been on hand</div>
<div class="indent">They&#8217;d burned up all the pitchy knots of pine.</div>
<div class="verse">And safe to say, they knew the word book well,</div>
<div class="verse">And as they plainly showed, knew how to spell.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It was the prettiest night I e&#8217;er did know:</div>
<div class="indent">The full moon did its very, very best;</div>
<div class="verse">The wains and sleighs came jingling o&#8217;er the snow;</div>
<div class="indent">For no one wished to miss the great contest.</div>
<div class="verse">Our frame school house was large, but ne&#8217;er before</div>
<div class="verse">So many glad folks were upon its floor.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Each school its spellers chose, and wrote each name</div>
<div class="indent">On paper, of not more than twelve and ten,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor less than twelve; and then enclosed the same</div>
<div class="indent">Within a drawing box from which two men</div>
<div class="verse">Then drew the names, and read one at a time,</div>
<div class="verse">While persons took alternate sides in line.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In final contest now each teacher stood</div>
<div class="indent">And spelled with pupils of his or her school.</div>

<div class="indent">And breathless the spectators viewed the same.</div>
<div class="verse">A plucky lad or lass some times would fall,</div>
<div class="verse">Hit by some fatal word as &#8220;minnie&#8221; ball.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">And weighed again their chance of winning out.</div>
<div class="verse">Folks drank in every sound to see if fair;</div>
<div class="indent">And as theirs scored, just ached to give a shout</div>
<div class="verse">For joy; not so when one of their clan fell:</div>
<div class="verse">A sad regret upon their mien would tell.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When forty minutes more had raged combat,</div>
<div class="indent">Sadly depleted had become those lines:</div>

<div class="verse">Opponents&#8217; sole survivor, scared the least.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For twenty minutes more, the battle raged;</div>
<div class="indent">The words were spelled hot from pronouncer&#8217;s lips;</div>
<div class="verse">Each standing speller stern defiance waged;</div>
<div class="indent">For keen tense nerves did obviate all slips.</div>
<div class="verse">Over one hundred words were given out</div>
<div class="verse">Free from a single mishap or a rout.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The mediator then sought harder words;</div>
<div class="indent">And while he searched the audience relaxed;</div>
<div class="verse">Respired more easily, a trifle stirred:</div>
<div class="indent">That intense hour had them severely taxed.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet, those two districts whose race was not done</div>
<div class="verse">Maintained a sphinx composure, every one.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Since but four stood, they now spelled in rotation.</div>
<div class="indent">First Charley Travelute got &#8220;surreptitious&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">And Emma Kister spelled &#8220;transfiguration.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">To Sally Tarvin went the word &#8220;officious&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">Next Peter Kerschen overcame &#8220;horehound&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">And in this fashion then the words went round.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Topaz&#8221;; &#8220;priory&#8221;; &#8220;orgy&#8221;; &#8220;orphanage&#8221;;</div>

<div class="verse">&#8220;Escutcheon&#8221;; &#8220;frenzy&#8221;; &#8220;intercede&#8221;; &#8220;lasso&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">And likewise &#8220;sentimental&#8221;, &#8220;domino.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some fifty words were rapidly pronounced;</div>
<div class="indent">No ripple in the spelling could be made;</div>
<div class="verse">The spellers with determination pounced</div>
<div class="indent">Upon the words that at their door were laid.</div>
<div class="verse">A sore fatigue showed in the speaker&#8217;s tongue,</div>
<div class="verse">As doggedly still forth the words he flung.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At length he paused, as if he plainly saw,</div>
<div class="indent">There&#8217;d be no end; they would hold out till dawn.</div>
<div class="verse">He asked: &#8220;Shall we now call this bout a draw?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">A hundred voices roared, &#8220;go on!&#8221; &#8220;go on!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So, turning many pages farther then,</div>
<div class="verse">The spelling contest forward moved again.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How these words stung! &#8220;Medallion&#8221;; &#8220;juvenile&#8221;;</div>

<div class="indent">And &#8220;negligible.&#8221; Such terms carried glory</div>
<div class="verse">Alike to those who spelled as well as to those</div>
<div class="verse">Who misspelled; for, to both an honor rose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O, how oblivious were those old time boys!</div>
<div class="indent">One could have heard a pin drop anywhere.</div>
<div class="verse">No doubt some hearts anticipated joys;</div>
<div class="indent">While some the pangs of sad regret did share.</div>
<div class="verse">And some were musing rather fervently</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twixt hopes and fears of drear uncertainty.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mysterious mind! Oh why this painful hush?</div>
<div class="indent">The long hoped battle&#8217;s on&mdash;in high white heat;</div>
<div class="verse">Each has won one; now they hope yet to crush;</div>
<div class="indent">A minute small may tell the tale&mdash;who beat?</div>
<div class="verse">And with that honor lustering some school,</div>
<div class="verse">Some one stands idolized and beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Icicle&#8221; then was spelled by Peter Kerschen;</div>
<div class="indent">With &#8220;judgment&#8221; Charley Travelute got thru;</div>
<div class="verse">Next Emma Kister won the word &#8220;emersion&#8221;;</div>
<div class="indent">And Sally Tarvin likewise &#8220;kangaroo.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! Kerschen dropped &#8220;s&#8221; from &#8220;isosceles.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet Travelute repaired the flaw with ease.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This finished the west side. But on they went&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Domestic&#8221;; &#8220;criticism&#8221;; &#8220;cavalier&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Harang&#8221;; &#8220;vicinity&#8221;; &#8220;ingredient&#8221;;</div>
<div class="indent">Alas! Miss Kister lost on &#8220;Belvedere.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Miss Tarvin quickly spelled the word aright;</div>
<div class="verse">So only two were standing in the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So anxious was the crowd to see who won,</div>
<div class="indent">They thought it half revealed when she sat down;</div>
<div class="verse">And from the concourse rose a subdued moan</div>
<div class="indent">In expectation of that lucky one.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet &#8217;twas in vain; none knew; and none could tell;</div>
<div class="verse">These two were trained and tried; they both could spell.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Breathless the crowd looked for the coming dawn&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">The coming dawn of victory and defeat.</div>
<div class="verse">Their faces some concealed; and some looked wan;</div>
<div class="indent">Some even rose unconscious to their feet.</div>
<div class="verse">And in the rear the packed-in throng did strain;</div>
<div class="verse">Stood on tip-toe to better view the game.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Outside &#8217;twas winter, and the snow lay deep;</div>
<div class="indent">The frost with icy style was tracing scenes</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the window panes in spite of heat</div>
<div class="indent">That rolled beyond the huge stove&#8217;s screens.</div>
<div class="verse">But still no cold was felt; forgot the clime;</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps some mused that it was summertime.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But these two spellers stood unmoved and calm;</div>
<div class="indent">They knew their mission, and that kept above</div>
<div class="verse">All else. Their friends, who wistfully looked on,</div>
<div class="indent">Looked them their ardent hopes and prayers and love.</div>
<div class="verse">This confidence was not reposed amiss:</div>
<div class="verse">For no mentality as worth as this.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O rude ordeal, betwixt two such minds!</div>
<div class="indent">Two bright young folks in rosy morn of life:</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet girlhood that mild womanhood entwines;</div>
<div class="indent">And manhood young trained for the world&#8217;s hard strife;</div>
<div class="verse">It seemed a prank of fate, deep, strained, and hard,</div>
<div class="verse">But yet it must go on to its reward.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There was no moment lost; the hard words flew</div>
<div class="indent">From the pronouncer&#8217;s tongue like league base balls;</div>
<div class="verse">And as if veteran scholars, so spelled two,</div>
<div class="indent">Still at their post of duty &#8217;long the walls.</div>
<div class="verse">They were the brilliant stars, and high did rise</div>
<div class="verse">In the fond gaze of all admiring eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Full thirty words went forth in steady run;</div>
<div class="indent">And each the audience thought would be the last.</div>
<div class="verse">But each was caught by speller as if in fun;</div>
<div class="indent">Or charmed by magic for this august task.</div>
<div class="verse">The oldest there had ne&#8217;er such contest heard</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein so little boot a stubborn word.</div>

<div class="verse">An overgrown lad, quite a bit dismayed,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When a young chap I was jolly and gay;</div>
<div class="indent2">Not a lark was as merry as I;</div>
<div class="verse">I whistled and sang both night and day;</div>
<div class="indent2">And the hours in pleasure swung by.</div>
<div class="verse">No parties or dances for miles around</div>
<div class="indent2">But what I attended with glee;</div>
<div class="verse">And wherever I frolicked the girls me found</div>
<div class="indent2">And chatted and flirted with me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="center">Chorus.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">But I was still single then!</div>
<div class="verse">O that I were single again!</div>

<div class="indent2">As I moved in the young gay throng.</div>
<div class="verse">I never had trouble to find a miss</div>
<div class="indent2">To accompany me to the ball;</div>
<div class="verse">My greatest concern always lay in this;</div>
<div class="indent2">That I could not wait on them all.</div>

<div class="verse">Chorus: But I was, etc.</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But one time a lass at a ball I met</div>
<div class="indent2">Who gave me an ache in my heart.</div>
<div class="verse">I took her to church and made her my pet,</div>
<div class="indent2">And out on life&#8217;s journey did start.</div>
<div class="verse">We have been married now for years one score;</div>
<div class="indent2">I must work from morning till night;</div>
<div class="verse">Six babes come to meet me at our door,</div>
<div class="indent2">And our living puts me to fright.</div>

<div class="verse">But now my pockets are empty and bare;</div>
<div class="indent2">And the girls never smile at me;</div>
<div class="verse">My poor heart is overburdened with care;</div>
<div class="indent2">And the world yields a pitiless fee.</div>
<div class="verse">So boys meditate on my sad plight;</div>
<div class="indent2">Don&#8217;t tie up your gay hearts too soon,</div>
<div class="verse">Do treat the girls with respect and delight;</div>
<div class="indent2">But just let them giggle and spoon.</div>

<div class="verse">This sure delighted them. How they did cheer!</div>
<div class="indent">The sentiment was light; the tune was gay.</div>
<div class="verse">Such airy ditties people like to hear,</div>
<div class="indent">And with such happy veins are borne away.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas ever so; the human heart, &#8217;tho staid,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The other singer was James Carbott, who</div>
<div class="indent">A way had all his own; and when he sang,</div>
<div class="verse">His hearers to him like a magnet drew;</div>
<div class="indent">Their fancy tickled and their laughter rang,</div>
<div class="verse">Until they were enraptured thru and thru;</div>
<div class="verse">The more he sang the more this feeling grew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He was the opera star in this young crowd,</div>
<div class="indent">Well seasoned as a wielder of the birch;</div>
<div class="verse">By neither class nor audience was cowed:</div>
<div class="indent">He had the gift of song a hundred worth.</div>
<div class="verse">He sentimental songs could ably sing;</div>
<div class="verse">But at comics was an operatic king.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">That night his old time energy was there;</div>
<div class="indent">He threw his heart and soul into the song.</div>
<div class="verse">When e&#8217;er his name was mentioned anywhere,</div>
<div class="indent">A gust of high hopes overtook the throng,</div>
<div class="verse">Because he had been heard ofttimes before,</div>
<div class="verse">And he had always pleased them&mdash;even more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His hearers always reaped a fond delight;</div>
<div class="indent">Such thrills as e&#8217;er a noble singer brings;</div>

<div class="indent">And on the heights of ecstacy take wings&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Those gifts of voice and heart that others beam</div>
<div class="verse">With floods of mirth while yet itself serene.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The program of the evening neared its close,</div>
<div class="indent">When some admirer called out Carbott&#8217;s name;</div>
<div class="verse">A dozen called it then. He slowly rose</div>
<div class="indent">And said, &#8220;The hour&#8217;s late; time we&#8217;re going home,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But leave, they&#8217;d not, without from him a song;</div>
<div class="verse">They called and cheered; and cheered and called along.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Just one,&#8221; he said, and took his chair ahead.</div>
<div class="indent">He hummed awhile as if him to imbue</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the melody; then out he led</div>
<div class="indent">To carol, &#8220;In the Valley of the Blue.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">He sang as sings a sorrow sweetened heart,</div>
<div class="verse">Which made from some eyes silent tear drops start:&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse">In the bonnie Big Blue valley</div>

<div class="verse">And the bright sun in its journey</div>
<div class="verse">Around the globe never shone</div>
<div class="verse">On a happier wedded couple</div>
<div class="verse">Than dwelt in this new home.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="center">Chorus.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She was happy as the blue birds</div>
<div class="verse">And as playful as the rills;</div>
<div class="verse">And as pretty as the blue bells</div>
<div class="verse">That swayed upon the hills&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">When we settled in the prairie</div>
<div class="verse">In the valley of the Blue,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I and my darling Hallie</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="center">II.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There we sang and toiled together</div>
<div class="verse">From rosy morn till night,</div>
<div class="verse">In the clear and cloudy weather</div>
<div class="verse">With a rapturous delight.</div>
<div class="verse">And altho our hut was humble</div>
<div class="verse">Our hearts were glad and warm,</div>
<div class="verse">And the promise of a fortune</div>
<div class="verse">Lay in sight in our farm.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The good oxen broke the prairie,</div>
<div class="verse">In the sod we hoed the corn;</div>
<div class="verse">Sunny summer waved its streamers,</div>
<div class="verse">Golden autumn filled its horn.</div>
<div class="verse">And with this crop so plenty</div>
<div class="verse">And the help of silvery wheat,</div>
<div class="verse">We contrived to pay the mortgage,</div>
<div class="verse">And the other wants defeat.</div>

<div class="verse">Chorus: She was happy, etc.</div>

<div class="verse">But one August came the fever,</div>
<div class="verse">And it scourged the Valley&#8217;s length;</div>

<div class="verse">While it sapped our joy and strength.</div>
<div class="verse">And before the autumn leaves fell</div>
<div class="verse">With their russet, red and gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Those verdant sods of Deer Creek</div>
<div class="verse">My dear Hallie&#8217;s form did hold.</div>

<div class="verse">In this land still rise my labors,</div>

<div class="verse">Just as brothers are my neighbors,</div>
<div class="verse">Big-hearted, kind and sweet;</div>
<div class="verse">But ne&#8217;er can I cease weeping,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of glad young days;</div>
<div class="verse">And the heart that long is sleeping</div>

<div class="verse">When he had finished, they cheered him and cheered;</div>
<div class="indent">He shook his head to this immense encore;</div>
<div class="verse">They would not stop; they simply whooped and cheered:</div>
<div class="indent">They loved his sentimental songs, but wore</div>
<div class="verse">A longing to laugh thru a jolly lay;</div>
<div class="verse">And must hear one before they&#8217;d go away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So he arose and forward went again;</div>
<div class="indent">He mused awhile; he knew not what to sing.</div>
<div class="verse">Then lo! His face lit with a mental flame;</div>
<div class="indent">He found one that to them much joy would bring;</div>
<div class="verse">Then with a jolly mien and mirth for all</div>
<div class="verse">He sang that rollicking lay, &#8220;Lanigan&#8217;s Ball.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This had the psychological effect:</div>
<div class="indent">The whole house went roaring rollicking glad.</div>
<div class="verse">It was a fitting state of mind for that</div>
<div class="indent">August assembly, strained, tired, and sad.</div>
<div class="verse">The happy hearts turned to their homeward way,</div>
<div class="verse">To long remember this eventful day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The moon still shone far over hills and plains;</div>
<div class="indent">You still could hear the fainter jingling bells</div>
<div class="verse">Of the glad sleighs, and snow songs of the wains;</div>
<div class="indent">And chatter of the squads in tell-tale dells.</div>
<div class="verse">And from the north, sung by James Gallaher&#8217;s band,</div>
<div class="verse">The old school song waked all the snowy land.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With &#8220;Then ring, then ring, ye light fairy bells;</div>
<div class="indent">Let sweet happy voices chime with the dances,</div>
<div class="verse">When the midnight army advances&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">As this one did, &#8220;forth from the shady dells.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And when those sounds died on the night air cool,</div>
<div class="verse">Just past was that last Old Time Spelling School.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some of those people are now ag&#8217;d and gray;</div>
<div class="indent">Their scions&#8217; children have in schools their place.</div>
<div class="verse">Some of those folks have long since moved away;</div>
<div class="indent">And people have forgotten their kind face.</div>
<div class="verse">But more of them now sleep beneath the flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">In that sweet bed that will in time be ours.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some heard the angel&#8217;s call &#8217;mid youth and hope;</div>
<div class="indent">While others traveled half way up life&#8217;s way.</div>
<div class="verse">Some, while descending on the farther slope;</div>
<div class="indent">Others met life&#8217;s fate when their locks were gray.</div>
<div class="verse">But such is life&mdash;a glint of sunshine made;</div>
<div class="verse">A moment&#8217;s smile amid an endless shade.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now the thread is run; this rhyme must end;</div>
<div class="indent">The curtain raised we must again let fall,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tho sad regret this close to hearts may send.</div>
<div class="indent">Such is the fate of man&#8217;s tasks, each and all.</div>
<div class="verse">But hoping that this tale delighted you,</div>
<div class="verse">I bid you, patient friends, a kind adieu.</div>
